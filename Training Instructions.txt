######## INSTALLATION #########

Clone the repo https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection.git

For installation instructions - https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/en/get_started.md

Create a folder checkpoints/ within Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection/ and download the file cascade_mask_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7.pth from GitHub.
https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.2/cascade_mask_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7.pth


##### TRAINING CASCADE RCNN SWIN TRANSFORMER FOR OBJECT DETECTION #######

1. Create a folder, say "PROJECT_NAME" and place it within Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection/configs/ folder
2. Under the folder Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection/configs/PROJECT_NAME/ create two sub folders train/ and test/
	2.a. put all the training images and train annotation file (.json file) within train/
	2.b. put all the test images and test annotation file (.json file) within test/
3. Copy the following python files to the folder Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection/configs/PROJECT_NAME/
	3.a. cascade_rcnn_swin_fpn.py
	3.b. cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_coco.py
	3.c. cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_PROJECT_NAME.py
4. Make changes to 3.c. - specify the class number, class names and the path for train and test folders

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final directory structure should look like....

Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection/

	checkpoints/
		cascade_mask_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7.pth

	configs/
		PROJECT_NAME/
			train/
				training images
				train annotation file.json
			test/
				test images
				test annotation file.json
			cascade_rcnn_swin_fpn.py
			cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_coco.py
			cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_PROJECT_NAME.py

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. For training python tools/train.py configs/PROJECT_NAME/cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_PROJECT_NAME.py

6. For multi-gpu training tools/dist_train.sh configs/PROJECT_NAME/cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_PROJECT_NAME.py 4 -------->>>>> 4 means number of GPU's

7. After training is completed, the newly trained models and the configs are available in the folder Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection/work_dirs/cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_PROJECT_NAME/

	Use cascade_rcnn_swin_small_patch4_window7_mstrain_480-800_giou_4conv1f_adamw_3x_PROJECT_NAME.py and latest.pth for inference

8. For image/video inference of newly trained models refer to - https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_exist_data_model.html
